As the office manager, she sees how comfortable everyone is with the corporate chaplain, and they all know that he is there to talk about anything. He was there for Miller when she dealt with the loss of her father and her mother-in-law, but he also tries to know what is going on in everyone’s life to celebrate, such as the when her grandchildren were born and her son got married.

Her hope is to build relationships with people and help them to let down those walls enough to get the help they need to deal with the struggles of life. With permission to share, Hanson is able to highlight the benefits that she has seen in the life of one employee by sharing briefly about the interactions that they have had. Hanson feels that the relational nature of the chaplaincy program allows employees to meet and get to know the chaplains before a crisis hits, making it easier to turn to them when help is needed. Incorporating her background in business and her desire to help those in need, watch this video to see why Hanson chose to get involved with workplace chaplaincy, and why she feels that it’s what’s missing in business.');

That’s what matters most, and corporate chaplaincy is just a great opportunity to do that.” While the work that he does helps the company and helps productivity, what matters most to Best is: “at the end of the day to feel like you’ve done something significant that really affects relationships and really helps people grow, what gets better than that?” Watch this video to hear Best explain why he truly enjoys serving as a corporate chaplain, helping employees, helping business owners, and helping businesses.');

					<p>Our mission is to provide help and hope to company owners, managers, and employees by building relationships and serving through a Chaplain Assistance Program.</p>
					<p>
					The tangible benefits of corporate chaplaincy are numerous:  from improved attitudes, cooperation, and performance to increased loyalty and commitment to the job. Decreases in anxiety and stress coupled with greater company loyalty all result in a lower turnover rate and higher productivity which have a direct positive impact on the bottom line.</p>
