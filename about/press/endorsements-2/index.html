				<h2><strong>Capital Chaplains Client Testimonials</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p><em>“I don’t know who you can totally trust within an organization that is allowed to keep everything confident. You feel like everything might go to the boss, but with the chaplaincy program, you know that you’re just speaking to somebody who has your interest at heart.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Karen Miller, Office Manager, A &amp; J Specialty Services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em> “One of the things that I recognized is that life happens and we have people who experience crisis or tragedy in their lives and that takes a lot for a manger to deal with and we often don’t have the background or ability or knowledge to be of maximum help to our employees. “ </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Karon Morton, VP and Director of Operations, InterVarsity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The chaplains I think help express the importance of each person on behalf of management but they also relieve management of some of the care and concern that we would like to have but may not have the time to have.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Karon Morton, VP and Director of Operations, InterVarsity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When you have a person in crisis you both want to care for the person but you also have to make up for the fact that they’re not being productive they may be out for an extended period of time or there may be fall out from their inability to perform their job function.  You’re trying to deal with the person and you’re trying to deal with the work that needs to get done and having the chaplains come alongside and at least bear part of that with you relieves managers I think to be more productive in what they’re supposed to be about.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Karon Morton, VP and Director of Operations, InterVarsity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em> “We’re at work all day every day for our whole lives and there’s obviously things that are happening outside of work that would potentially affect every aspect of your life not only when you are outside of work but also when you’re at work.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kathleen, The Engelhart Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The chaplain is here for us to have somebody to talk that’s not necessarily your boss or a coworker who you may feel uncomfortable discussing highly personal or family issues with.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em>Kathleen, The Engelhart Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“{Workplace Chaplaincy} has created more of a family feeling in our store and I think that its been a real plus for us and I’ve been happy with it and we’re going to continue to do the corporate chaplaincy.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mike Coyle, Owner, Coyle Carpet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“We try to help our employees so we feel pretty good about the fact that we are able to offer chaplaincy to them. They can make use of it. Not everybody uses it, but I would say that of the people who didn’t initially use it, 95% of all employees are using it now.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mike Coyle, Owner,  Coyle Carpet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The chaplains have come alongside some of the people who’ve been in a crisis mode and helped them through it. It’s difficult enough to run a business but you’d also like to be able to help your employees through some of their crises. We can do that now with corporate chaplaincy.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mike Coyle, Owner,  Coyle Carpet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In terms of the value to a business owner, corporate chaplaincy really is a good value. I get feedback from employees and managers that the chaplain was a real help in someone’s crises. I think that is something you can actually measure . . .”</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mike Coyle, Owner,  Coyle Carpet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We all have problems and the chaplain has just been extremely wonderful in helping everybody, the whole unit, all the employees just deal with life.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kelly Brietzman, Pellitteri Waste Systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em> “My wife and I had a child that came early and my wife was in the hospital for six weeks prior to him being born. She was in the hospital in a coma state for three days and then after that in the hospital for another four weeks. Steve, the chaplain, would regularly come up there and talk with me and ask me how things were going and give me someone to talk to because I was kind of alone with Holly being incapacitated and my child being in the NICU. We were able to talk through things and pray and that gave me a lot of strength.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Travis Ganser, Owner,  Ganser Company</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When people are dealing with personal problems, you can’t separate your work life from your personal life because when your personal life gets turned upside down it does impact your work life. When people are able to deal with that and have a resource with Capital Chaplains, someone to talk to, someone to pray with, it takes off the pressure from the employee and they are able to do their job more thoroughly and ultimately make our company more productive.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em>Travis Ganser, Owner,  Ganser Company</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I think a lot of business owners would be concerned that the cost of the program is versus the pay back. The payback is even more than just a monetary payback it endears employees to the employer knowing that the employer cares about them on a different level other than just meeting a goal. When their families are whole they are happier people and I would say that makes them more loyal.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Travis Ganser, Owner, Ganser Company</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“My first thought when I would say something to someone who’s considering this is:  just do it.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Robert Dehnert, Pellitteri Waste Systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“It’s not a big capital outlay in regard to expense but the return is great . . . from a Human Resources aspect, if I keep one employee that I would have lost without the program, its paid for itself that year because there’s so much money involved with recruitment, with retention, you lose a person you’ve got to fill it and it adds up.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Robert Dehnert, Pellitteri Waste Systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“It is utilized well, the participation rate is great. It’s effective. It’s definitely cost effective and it’s well proven with larger companies that are doing this on a regular basis.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Robert Dehnert, Pellitteri Waste Systems</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>“A lot of places that I’ve worked at in the past have programs where you can go and see a counselor or an HR person but the corporate chaplain program for our people has really been that additional ear where somebody is on site talking to your people.  The chaplain is staying in touch with them, and following up them the next week.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Danielle Pellitteri, Pellitteri Waste Systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em> “As an employer it’s nice to know that you’ve got somebody to support your employees with their personal lives so that you’re not crossing that line.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Danielle Pellitteri, Pellitteri Waste Systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em> “I was named Vice President at twenty-five and that is very young. There is a lot of responsibility that goes along with that and a lot of different things that I had to face professionally and personally . . . the chaplain, really helped me go through that.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jocelyn Dornfeld, Ganser Company</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The manufacturing industry is usually about 80-90% male, so who does a guy talk to about his problems? You don’t talk to other guys about your home problems or your financial problems . . . you really don’t talk about personal problems, problems with your marriage, loss of a family member etc.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em>Chris Berry, Dane Manufacturing</p>
