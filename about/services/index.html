<p>2. Worksite Visits/Rounds: Based upon the employer’s request, chaplains will make brief, weekly, worksite visits in order to get to know employees and offer a moment of encouragement. If an employee has something he/she wants to discuss with the chaplain, it may be mentioned at that time. Depending on the nature and urgency of the employee need, the chaplain will coordinate a place and time for a follow-up meeting. This may be on a break, at lunch, by e-mail, or by phone.</p>
<p>3. Chaplain Visits: At the employee’s invitation, chaplains will make hospital, family home, nursing home, funeral home, and/or other neutral site visits when appropriate.</p>
